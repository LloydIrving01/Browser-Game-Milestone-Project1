# Browser-Game-Milestone-Project1
 
This repo is the first of 3 milestone projects in my Software Development course.

Having learned HTML, CSS, & Javascript, these are what will be used for my first browser game.

For this project, I have decided to create a simple game of hangman.

In this build my thought process for this game was the following:
    1)  Generate a word at random and store it in a variable
    2)  Display the length of the word to the user
    3)  Prompt the user to guess a letter
    4)  If the guess is correct, display the letter 
    5)  If the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses/mistakes by 1 
    6)  Next part of the hangman will show when incorrect
    7)  If the incorrect_guesses is equal to 6, the game is lost 
    8)  Game is won if correct guesses are equal to the length of the word
    9)  Button to reset the game if the game is either won or lost and generate a new word

The object of the game is simple; once the webpage is loaded, a random word will be generated.
Use the mouse and click on the letter you think is in the word.

You only are able to make 6 mistakes before you lose the game.
If you guess the word, Congrats!!, you've won; 

Have Fun!
